# Enhancing Answer Node Functionality and Markdown Rendering (2025-04-02 11:27:19)

_**User**_

Modify the 'answer' nodes so that if answer response text is > 1500 characters, it animates expanding the answer node's width to 150% of its initial size. The length of the node should always grow to fit the response length, no matter how long the response is.
Also the answer nodes are not respecting the full markdown syntax content, `### Header` text is not larger, nor does it have a empty new line directly after it.

Here is some preliminary information:
@FadeoutTextNode.tsx @GraphPage.tsx @fadeout-text.css @index.css 
1.  **`app/src/FadeoutTextNode.tsx`**:
    *   **Reason:** This is the React component responsible for rendering individual nodes (both questions and answers) in the graph.
    *   **Relevance:**
        *   It receives the `text` content and the `question` boolean (to identify answer nodes).
        *   It applies styling (including `maxWidth`, `height`, and CSS classes like `prose`).
        *   It uses `react-markdown` to render the text content.
        *   It uses `useMeasure` to determine content dimensions and updates the `nodeDims` state in the parent.
        *   Logic for checking text length (`> 1500`) and conditionally applying different styles (e.g., increased width) will go here.
        *   Adjustments to `react-markdown` usage or the surrounding CSS (`prose` classes) to fix header rendering will happen here.
        *   The animation logic (likely via CSS transitions already present or modified) will be controlled based on the conditional styling applied here.

2.  **`app/src/GraphPage.tsx`**:
    *   **Reason:** This component manages the overall graph state (`QATree`, `nodeDims`) and converts the `QATree` data into React Flow nodes and edges using `convertTreeToFlow`.
    *   **Relevance:**
        *   The `convertTreeToFlow` function is where nodes are created and the `data` prop (including `text` and `question: false` for answers) is passed to `FadeoutTextNode`. We need to ensure the logic correctly identifies answer nodes.
        *   It manages the `nodeDims` state, which is updated by `FadeoutTextNode`. While the primary logic for width change is in the node itself, understanding how `nodeDims` is used by the layout engine (`dagre` via `Flow.tsx`) might be necessary if the dynamic width change causes layout issues. However, direct modification might not be needed here for the core task.

3.  **`app/src/fadeout-text.css`**:
    *   **Reason:** This CSS file contains styles specifically targeting the `FadeoutTextNode` component.
    *   **Relevance:**
        *   It might contain styles that interfere with the Tailwind `prose` styles for Markdown rendering (specifically headers).
        *   New CSS classes or modifications to existing ones might be needed here to support the animated width change or to correct Markdown header styling.

4.  **`app/src/index.css`**:
    *   **Reason:** Contains the base Tailwind CSS imports and potentially global overrides.
    *   **Relevance:**
        *   The default Tailwind `prose` styles are applied via classes in `FadeoutTextNode.tsx`. If the base `prose` styles need adjustment specifically for headers (e.g., adding margin-bottom), overrides could potentially be placed here, although component-specific CSS or utility classes within the component itself are often preferred.

**In summary, the primary focus will be on `app/src/FadeoutTextNode.tsx` for implementing both the conditional width animation and fixing the Markdown rendering. `app/src/GraphPage.tsx` is relevant for context on how data flows and nodes are created. The CSS files (`app/src/fadeout-text.css` and potentially `app/src/index.css`) are relevant for debugging or implementing styling changes related to Markdown rendering.**

_**Assistant**_

Okay, I understand. You want to enhance the answer nodes (`!props.data.question`) in `FadeoutTextNode.tsx`:

1.  If the answer text is longer than 1500 characters, the node's maximum width should animate from 250px to 375px (150%) when clicked/expanded. The height should always adjust to fit the full content.
2.  Markdown headers (like `### Header`) should render correctly with appropriate size and spacing.

Let's start by modifying `FadeoutTextNode.tsx` to implement these changes.

I will:
1.  Introduce logic to check if it's a long answer node.
2.  Conditionally set the `maxWidth` based on this check.
3.  Update the `transition` style to include `maxWidth`.
4.  Adjust the `setNodeDims` call in the `onClick` handler to use the potentially larger width.
5.  Remove the `prose-sm` class to allow default `prose` header styling.

    return (
          }
          setExpanded(true);
-         // Now I have to call setNodeDims with the nodeID and set the width and height
+         // Use targetMaxWidth when setting dimensions
          props.data.setNodeDims((prevState) => ({
            ...prevState,

+           [props.data.nodeID]: { width: targetMaxWidth, height: actualHeight + (props.data.question && !props.data.hasAnswer ? 36 : 18) },
          }));
        }}
          borderRadius: 4,
          padding: "8px 12px",

+         maxWidth: targetMaxWidth,
          overflow: "hidden",
          height: props.data.question && !props.data.hasAnswer
                : "auto",
          transition:
-           "transform 0.5s, height 0.5s, width 0.5s, opacity 0.15s, border 0.15s",
+           "transform 0.5s, height 0.5s, width 0.5s, max-width 0.5s, opacity 0.15s, border 0.15s",
          paddingBottom: props.data.question && !props.data.hasAnswer ? "36px" : "8px",
        }}
        <Handle type={"source"} position={Position.Right} />
        <div
-         className={classNames("fadeout-text-inner prose prose-sm max-w-none", {
+         className={classNames("fadeout-text-inner prose max-w-none", {
            "h-[140px]": props.data.question && !expanded,
          })}
```

---

OK, I have modified `app/src/FadeoutTextNode.tsx`.

Here's a summary of the changes:
1.  Calculated `isLongAnswer` based on `!props.data.question && props.data.text.length > 1500`.
2.  Set `targetMaxWidth` to `375` if `isLongAnswer` is true, otherwise `250`.
3.  Applied `targetMaxWidth` to the node's `style.maxWidth`.
4.  Added `max-width` to the `style.transition` property.
5.  Updated the `setNodeDims` call in the `onClick` handler to use `targetMaxWidth`.
6.  Simplified the `height` calculation in the `style` prop: For answer nodes (`!props.data.question`), the height is now always `"auto"` to fit the content.
7.  Removed the `prose-sm` class from the inner `div` containing the `ReactMarkdown` component to allow default `prose` styling for markdown elements, including headers.

This should make long answer nodes expand their width when clicked and ensure that markdown headers render with the expected styling.

Please check if this behaves as you intended. Let me know if any further adjustments are needed.

---

_**User**_

ok, no change in the display of the header text.

---

_**Assistant**_

Hmm, okay. Since removing `prose-sm` didn't fix the header styling, let's check a couple of other things:

1.  **Tailwind Typography Plugin:** The `prose` classes rely on the `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin. Can you confirm if this plugin is installed (`npm install -D @tailwindcss/typography` or `yarn add -D @tailwindcss/typography`) and added to your `tailwind.config.js` file under the `plugins` array?

    ```javascript
    // tailwind.config.js
    module.exports = {
      // ... other config
      plugins: [
        require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
        // ... other plugins
      ],
    }
    ```

2.  **CSS Overrides:** Let's look at `app/src/fadeout-text.css` to see if any styles there might be interfering with the default header styles provided by `prose`.



---

Read file: app/src/fadeout-text.css

---

Okay, I've checked the contents of `app/src/fadeout-text.css`, and there don't seem to be any styles in there that would directly interfere with the Tailwind `prose` class's header styling (like overriding font sizes or margins for `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, etc.).

The next most likely reason is that the `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin might not be set up correctly. Could you please verify two things:

1.  **Installation:** Is the `@tailwindcss/typography` package installed as a dev dependency? You can check your `package.json` or try running `npm ls @tailwindcss/typography` / `yarn list --pattern "@tailwindcss/typography"`. If it's not installed, please run `npm install -D @tailwindcss/typography` or `yarn add -D @tailwindcss/typography`.
2.  **Configuration:** Is the plugin included in your `tailwind.config.js` file? It should look something like this:

    ```javascript
    // tailwind.config.js
    module.exports = {
      content: [
        "./index.html",
        "./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}", // Make sure your paths are correct
      ],
      theme: {
        extend: {},
      },
      plugins: [
        require('@tailwindcss/typography'), // This line must be present
        // other plugins...
      ],
    }
    ```

If the plugin is missing or not added to the config, please add it and restart your development server. Let me know if that resolves the header styling issue.

---

_**User**_

so we now have proper heading display, however it has created its own new issue. There is now excess 'padding' at the top of the node. I have pasted an image of the problem to show how it affects the questions and answers nodes.

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I see what you mean from the image. The header "Factors Influencing Memory Retention" in the answer node seems to have extra space above it compared to the question node's text.

This is likely because the Tailwind `prose` styles apply default top margins to elements like headings (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`) and paragraphs (`p`) to ensure proper spacing in a typical document flow. When `ReactMarkdown` renders your text, the first element (whether it's a paragraph or a heading) gets this default top margin, creating the extra space you're seeing.

We can fix this by specifically targeting the *first* element within the `prose` container and removing its top margin.

I will add the Tailwind utility class `prose-*:first:mt-0` to the `div` that has the `prose` class in `app/src/FadeoutTextNode.tsx`. This tells Tailwind to set the `margin-top` of the first direct child element (`*:first:`) within the `prose` container to `0`.



---

```diff
        <Handle type={"source"} position={Position.Right} />
        <div
-         className={classNames("fadeout-text-inner prose max-w-none", {
+         className={classNames(
+           "fadeout-text-inner prose max-w-none prose-*:first:mt-0",
+           {
              "h-[140px]": props.data.question && !expanded,
-         })}
+           }
+         )}
          style={expanded || !props.data.question ? { WebkitMaskImage: "none" } : {}}
        >
```

---

OK, I've added the `prose-*:first:mt-0` class to the `div` within `app/src/FadeoutTextNode.tsx`. This should remove the extra top margin from the first element rendered by `ReactMarkdown`, resolving the excess padding issue you observed in the image.

Please check the layout again and let me know if the spacing looks correct now.

---

_**User**_

i reversed your previous change, it made no difference. I did notice when inspecting with the devloper tools that it is a top margin being applied to the <h2> (2em), or the <p> (1.25em) elements

---

_**Assistant**_

Okay, thank you for confirming with the developer tools. It seems the `prose` styles are indeed applying the top margin as expected, but the `prose-*:first:mt-0` utility wasn't targeting it correctly.

My apologies, I applied the utility to the wrong `div`. Looking at the structure in `FadeoutTextNode.tsx`:

```typescript
      <div
        className={classNames(
          "fadeout-text-inner prose max-w-none", // <--- Prose styles applied here
          {
            "h-[140px]": props.data.question && !expanded,
          }
        )}
        style={expanded || !props.data.question ? { WebkitMaskImage: "none" } : {}}
      >
        <div ref={ref}> {/* <--- This div wraps ReactMarkdown */}
          <ReactMarkdown remarkPlugins={[remarkGfm]}>
            {props.data.text}
          </ReactMarkdown> {/* <--- Output starts here (e.g., <h2> or <p>) */}
        </div>
      </div>
```

The `<h2>` or `<p>` elements generated by `ReactMarkdown` are children of the `div` with `ref={ref}`, not direct children of the `div` with the `prose` class. Therefore, the `prose-*:first:mt-0` modifier on the outer `div` didn't affect the inner elements.

We need to target the first child of the inner `div ref={ref}`. Let's use Tailwind's arbitrary variant syntax `[&>*:first-child]:mt-0` directly on this inner `div`.

I'll modify `app/src/FadeoutTextNode.tsx` to add this class.



---

```diff
          style={expanded || !props.data.question ? { WebkitMaskImage: "none" } : {}}
        >
-         <div ref={ref}>
+         <div ref={ref} className="[&>*:first-child]:mt-0">
            <ReactMarkdown remarkPlugins={[remarkGfm]}>
              {props.data.text}
```

---

OK, I have applied the Tailwind arbitrary variant `[&>*:first-child]:mt-0` to the inner `div` that wraps the `ReactMarkdown` component in `app/src/FadeoutTextNode.tsx`.

This targets the first element (`h2`, `p`, etc.) rendered by `ReactMarkdown` inside that `div` and should set its top margin to 0, removing the extra space you identified.

Please check the node rendering again. Hopefully, this resolves the spacing issue correctly this time!

---

_**User**_

how can we make the node's border thicker

---

_**Assistant**_

You can make the border thicker by changing the Tailwind border width class applied to the main `div` in `app/src/FadeoutTextNode.tsx`.

Currently, it uses the `border` class, which defaults to 1px width. You can replace it with `border-2` (for 2px width), `border-4` (for 4px width), etc., depending on how thick you want it.

Let's change it to `border-2` for now.

I will edit `app/src/FadeoutTextNode.tsx` and replace the `border` class with `border-2`.



---

```diff
          e.stopPropagation();
        }}
-       className={classNames("fadeout-text border bg-white text-black", {
+       className={classNames("fadeout-text border-2 bg-white text-black", {
          "cursor-pointer": !expanded,
          "cursor-default": expanded,
```

---

I've updated the class in `app/src/FadeoutTextNode.tsx`. The nodes should now render with a 2px border. Let me know if you'd like to try a different thickness!

---

_**User**_

maybe 3px thick

---

_**Assistant**_

Okay, let's try 3px. Since Tailwind doesn't have a built-in `border-3` class, we can use an arbitrary value directly.

I will edit `app/src/FadeoutTextNode.tsx` and replace `border-2` with `border-[3px]`.



---

```diff
          e.stopPropagation();
        }}
-       className={classNames("fadeout-text border-2 bg-white text-black", {
+       className={classNames("fadeout-text border-[3px] bg-white text-black", {
          "cursor-pointer": !expanded,
          "cursor-default": expanded,
```

---

Done. I've changed the class to `border-[3px]` in `app/src/FadeoutTextNode.tsx`. The nodes should now have a 3px border.

---

_**User**_

the text inside th nodes eg, the question nodes and partially the answer nodes is a grey color, instead of text-black like it should be?

---

_**Assistant**_

You're right, I see the `text-black` class was applied to the main parent `div` in `FadeoutTextNode.tsx`. However, the text itself is inside the `div` with the Tailwind `prose` class:

```typescript
      <div
        className={classNames(
          "fadeout-text-inner prose max-w-none prose-*:first:mt-0", // <--- Prose applied here
          // ...
        )}
        // ...
      >
        <div ref={ref} className="[&>*:first-child]:mt-0">
          <ReactMarkdown remarkPlugins={[remarkGfm]}>
            {props.data.text} {/* Text rendered inside prose */}
          </ReactMarkdown>
        </div>
      </div>
```

The `prose` class applies its own set of styles, including a default text color (usually a shade of gray like `text-gray-700`). This default `prose` text color overrides the `text-black` you set on the parent `div`.

To fix this, we need to explicitly set the text color *on the element that has the `prose` class*.

I will add the `text-black` class to the `div` with the `prose` class in `app/src/FadeoutTextNode.tsx`.



---

```diff
        <div
          className={classNames(
-           "fadeout-text-inner prose max-w-none",
+           "fadeout-text-inner prose max-w-none prose-*:first:mt-0 text-black",
            {
              "h-[140px]": props.data.question && !expanded,
```

---

Okay, I've added the `text-black` class to the `div` that also has the `prose` class in `app/src/FadeoutTextNode.tsx`.

This should override the default text color provided by `prose` and make the text render as black in both question and answer nodes. Please verify the change.

---

_**User**_

in the answers text, the ordered list numbers, and unordered list bullets are still grey

---

_**Assistant**_

You've hit another common subtlety with Tailwind's `prose` styles! By default, `prose` styles list markers (the numbers in ordered lists and the bullets in unordered lists) with a specific gray color, separate from the main text color.

We need to explicitly tell Tailwind to make the list markers black as well. We can do this by adding another utility class targeting the `::marker` pseudo-element for list items (`li`) within the `prose` scope.

I will add the `prose-li:marker:text-black` class to the `div` that already has the `prose` and `text-black` classes in `app/src/FadeoutTextNode.tsx`.



---

```diff
        <div
          className={classNames(
-           "fadeout-text-inner prose max-w-none prose-*:first:mt-0 text-black",
+           "fadeout-text-inner prose max-w-none prose-*:first:mt-0 text-black prose-li:marker:text-black",
            {
              "h-[140px]": props.data.question && !expanded,
```

---

Okay, I've added the `prose-li:marker:text-black` utility class to the `div` in `app/src/FadeoutTextNode.tsx`.

This should specifically target the list markers within the `prose`-styled content and set their color to black. Please check if the list numbers and bullets are now black as intended.

---

_**User**_

I have pasted an image to illustrate the issue. there is far too much margin or padding around the list items, there should be a small gap between the ordered list item (aka `1. Diet and Nutrition`) and the unordered list item (`• Cultural dietary habits can significantly affect health.` however the gap between each unordered list item should be negligable.

---

_**Assistant**_

Got it. Looking at the image, the default `prose` styles are adding significant vertical margins around the list items (`<li>`) and possibly the nested list (`<ul>`) itself, creating those large gaps.

We can reduce these margins using Tailwind's utility classes that modify the `prose` styles. Let's try reducing the vertical margin (`margin-top` and `margin-bottom`) for all list items (`li`) within the `prose` container.

I will add the `prose-li:my-1` utility class to the `div` that already contains the other `prose` classes in `app/src/FadeoutTextNode.tsx`. This should decrease the vertical spacing around each list item, including the ordered and unordered ones.



---

```diff
        <div
          className={classNames(
-           "fadeout-text-inner prose max-w-none prose-*:first:mt-0 text-black prose-li:marker:text-black",
+           "fadeout-text-inner prose max-w-none prose-*:first:mt-0 text-black prose-li:marker:text-black prose-li:my-1",
            {
              "h-[140px]": props.data.question && !expanded,
```

---

Okay, I've added the `prose-li:my-1` class to the `div` in `app/src/FadeoutTextNode.tsx`. This applies a smaller vertical margin (0.25rem) to all list items (`<li>`).

This should reduce the spacing between the items within the unordered list ("• Cultural dietary habits..." and "• Traditional foods...") and also decrease the gap between the ordered list item ("1. Diet and Nutrition") and the start of the unordered list.

Please check if the spacing looks better now. We might need to adjust further, perhaps targeting the nested list (`ul`) margins specifically if the gap between the number and the bullets is still too large.

---

_**User**_

need to adjust line-height in prose to be 1.25em

---

_**Assistant**_

Okay, you want to set the line height for the text within the `prose` container to `1.25`. In Tailwind, the class `leading-tight` corresponds to a line height of 1.25.

We can add this class to the `div` that has the `prose` class in `app/src/FadeoutTextNode.tsx`.



---

```diff
        <div
          className={classNames(
-           "fadeout-text-inner prose max-w-none prose-*:first:mt-0 text-black prose-li:marker:text-black prose-li:my-1",
+           "fadeout-text-inner prose max-w-none prose-*:first:mt-0 text-black prose-li:marker:text-black prose-li:my-1 leading-tight",
            {
              "h-[140px]": props.data.question && !expanded,
```

---

I've added the `leading-tight` class to the `div` with the `prose` styles in `app/src/FadeoutTextNode.tsx`. This should adjust the line height for the text within the nodes to 1.25.

Please check if the line spacing looks correct now.

---

_**User**_

i would like the gap indicated by the orange lines i drew on the screenshot reduced. Whether its an ordered <ol> list's first <li> or unordered <ul> lists firsrt <li> then it does not need such a big top margin. maybe half the top margin size.

---

_**Assistant**_

Understood. You want to specifically reduce the top margin of the *first* list item (`li`) within any ordered (`ol`) or unordered (`ul`) list, as indicated by the orange lines. The current `prose-li:my-1` affects all list items, but the first one in each list still inherits a larger default top margin from the base `prose` styles.

We can target this specific scenario using Tailwind's arbitrary variants. We'll add classes to the `div` containing the `prose` styles to select the first `li` child of any `ul` or `ol` and reduce its top margin. Let's try setting it to `0.25em`, which is half the typical `prose` list item top margin.

I will modify `app/src/FadeoutTextNode.tsx` by adding the following classes to the `div` that has the `prose` class:
*   `[&_ul>li:first-child]:mt-[0.25em]`
*   `[&_ol>li:first-child]:mt-[0.25em]`



---

```diff
          className={classNames(
            "fadeout-text-inner prose max-w-none prose-*:first:mt-0 text-black prose-li:marker:text-black prose-li:my-1 leading-tight",
+           "[&_ul>li:first-child]:mt-[0.25em] [&_ol>li:first-child]:mt-[0.25em]",
            {
              "h-[140px]": props.data.question && !expanded,
```

---

Okay, I've added the two arbitrary variant classes to the `div` with the `prose` styles in `app/src/FadeoutTextNode.tsx`.

This should specifically target the first list item (`li`) within any unordered (`ul`) or ordered (`ol`) list inside the `prose` container and reduce its top margin, addressing the gaps highlighted by the orange lines in your screenshot.

Please check the rendering of the lists again.

---

_**User**_

change that, its the top margin of a nested <ul> or <ol>, 

---

Ah, okay, thanks for clarifying. You want to reduce the top margin of the entire nested list (`ul` or `ol`) itself, not just its first item. The default `prose` styles add margins to `ul` and `ol` elements as well.

Let's remove the previous change targeting the first `li` and instead target the `ul` and `ol` elements directly within the `prose` context to reduce their top margin. We can try setting their top margin to `0.25em` as well.

I will:
1. Remove the `[&_ul>li:first-child]:mt-[0.25em]` and `[&_ol>li:first-child]:mt-[0.25em]` classes.
2. Add `[&_ul]:mt-[0.25em]` and `[&_ol]:mt-[0.25em]` classes to the `div` with the `prose` styles in `app/src/FadeoutTextNode.tsx`.

```diff
          className={classNames(
            "fadeout-text-inner prose max-w-none prose-*:first:mt-0 text-black prose-li:marker:text-black prose-li:my-1 leading-tight",
-           "[&_ul>li:first-child]:mt-[0.25em] [&_ol>li:first-child]:mt-[0.25em]",
+           "[&_ul]:mt-[0.25em] [&_ol]:mt-[0.25em]",
            {
              "h-[140px]": props.data.question && !expanded,
```

Okay, I've updated the classes in `app/src/FadeoutTextNode.tsx`.

I removed the previous variants targeting the first list item and added new variants `[&_ul]:mt-[0.25em]` and `[&_ol]:mt-[0.25em]` to directly reduce the top margin of any `ul` or `ol` elements found within the `prose` styled text.

This should reduce the gap *above* the entire nested list (like the bulleted list under "1. Diet and Nutrition"). Please check the spacing again.

there is also a bottom margin after the <p>. Can we have <p> tags have a top margin of 1.0em and a bottom margin of 0px

```example_of_rendered_html
<h2>Reasons Memories Fade Over Time</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Frequency of Recall</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Memories that are recalled often tend to stay vivid.</li>
<li>Rarely revisited memories may fade.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Emotional Impact</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Highly Emotional Events:</strong> Tend to be remembered better (e.g., weddings, accidents).</li>
<li><strong>Neutral Events:</strong> Less emotionally charged memories might fade away.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Context and Significance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Memories tied to significant life events are usually retained.</li>
<li>Everyday memories may lose context and importance over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interference</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Retroactive Interference:</strong> New memories can disrupt old ones.</li>
<li><strong>Proactive Interference:</strong> Old memories can overshadow new information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Age and Cognitive Decline</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As we age, our ability to retrieve and maintain memories may decline.</li>
<li>Neurological changes can impact memory retention.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Memory Reconstruction</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Memories can change over time due to reconstruction, leading to distortions.</li>
<li>Recalling memories can alter them slightly each time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sleep and Memory Consolidation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Quality of sleep affects how memories are consolidated into long-term storage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Memory retention is influenced by a combination of factors, including how often we think about a memory, its emotional weight, its contextual importance, and our cognitive health over time. 🧠✨</p>

Okay, you want to specifically control the margins for paragraph tags (`<p>`) within the `prose` styled content. You'd like a top margin of `1em` and a bottom margin of `0px`.

We can achieve this by adding two more arbitrary variant classes to the `div` containing the `prose` styles in `app/src/FadeoutTextNode.tsx`:

1.  `[&_p]:mt-[1em]` to set the top margin.
2.  `[&_p]:mb-0` to set the bottom margin.

I'll add these classes now.

+           "[&_p]:mt-[1em] [&_p]:mb-0",
            {
              "h-[140px]": props.data.question && !expanded,
```
