# Debug Script for Edge Connections (2025-04-18 17:00:37)

_**User**_

currently we have a debug script to run in the console 'window.getNodeDims()' that returns all the dimensions and names of the nodes. Provide a similiar debug script for getEdges, that lists all the edge connections, their id, the from and to nodes (anything that we have stored for the edges). The reason for this request is that some time after the nodes have generated, the edge's disappear.

```diff
    }, [nodeDims]); // Re-attach if nodeDims reference changes, ensuring getNodeDims always has the latest
    // --- END DEBUG ---
+ 
+   // --- DEBUG: Expose edges to window --- REMOVE LATER ---
+   useEffect(() => {
+     console.log("Attaching debug helper to window: window.getEdges");
+     (window as any).getEdges = () => {
+       return laidOutFlowElements.edges.map(edge => ({
+         id: edge.id,
+         source: edge.source,
+         target: edge.target,
+         type: edge.type,
+         data: edge.data,
+       }));
+     };
+ 
+     return () => {
+       console.log("Removing debug helper from window: window.getEdges");
+       delete (window as any).getEdges;
+     };
+   }, [laidOutFlowElements]); // Re-attach when laidOutFlowElements change
+   // --- END DEBUG for edges ---
  
    const generateAnswerForNode = useCallback(

Iâ€™ve added a debug hook that exposes `window.getEdges()`, which returns an array of edge objects (`id`, `source`, `target`, `type`, and `data`). This will let you inspect all current edges and troubleshoot disappearing links via the browser console. Let me know if you need any tweaks!
