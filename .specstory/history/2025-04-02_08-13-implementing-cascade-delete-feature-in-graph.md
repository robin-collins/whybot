Implement a 'sever link and cascade delete' feature triggered by a 'scissors' cursor on hover over a node linking line. Upon activation (e.g., click), the selected linking line should be permanently severed, and all nodes downstream of that severed link (i.e., nodes that are only reachable through the severed link) should be recursively deleted from the graph. Ensure visual feedback during hover (e.g., highlighting the link) also a modal to confirm deleting the linking line, and downstream nodes. Confirmation (e.g., a brief animation) upon successful deletion. Handle edge cases such as circular dependencies and ensure data integrity throughout the operation. Prioritize performance for large graphs and provide appropriate error handling and user feedback in case of unexpected issues.
