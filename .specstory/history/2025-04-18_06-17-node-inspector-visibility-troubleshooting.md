# Node Inspector Visibility Troubleshooting (2025-04-18 15:47:14)

_**User**_

can you add to the node inspector information re: visibility of the node, i am having nodes 'disapper' but if i toggle the node inspector, it says they are present.

Okay, I understand. Nodes might be marked as hidden in the React Flow state, or perhaps they are outside the viewport but still technically present.

I will modify the `DevNodeInfo` component within `app/src/Flow.tsx` to display the `hidden` status of each node. This will help diagnose if the nodes are disappearing because their `hidden` property is being set to `true`.

```diff
    measured?: { width?: number | null; height?: number | null };
    parentId?: string;
+   hidden?: boolean;
  }
  
- function DevNodeInfo({ id, position, data, width, height, selected, dragging, measured, parentId }: DevNodeInfoProps) {
+ function DevNodeInfo({ id, position, data, width, height, selected, dragging, measured, parentId, hidden }: DevNodeInfoProps) {
    // Use measured dimensions if available, otherwise fallback
    const nodeWidth = measured?.width ?? width ?? 0;
             <div style={{ color: '#e2e8f0' }}>Q: {data.question.substring(0, 100)}{data.question.length > 100 ? '...' : ''}</div>
        )}
+ 
+       {/* Display Hidden status */}
+       {hidden && <div style={{ color: '#F56565' }}>Hidden: true</div>}
  
        {selected && <div style={{ color: '#63B3ED' }}>Selected</div>}
```

OK, I've added the `hidden` status indicator to the `DevNodeInfo` component in `app/src/Flow.tsx`. If a node's `hidden` property is `true`, it will now display "Hidden: true" in red within the inspector overlay for that node. This should help determine if the nodes are disappearing due to being explicitly hidden in the React Flow state.
