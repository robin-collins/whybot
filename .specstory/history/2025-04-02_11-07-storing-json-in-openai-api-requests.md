# Storing JSON in OpenAI API Requests (2025-04-02 21:37:43)

_**User**_

I would like the json input supplied to `openai.chat.completions.create()` stored in a variable first called oai_request_json, I also want the reconstructed resultant stream stored to a variable also as oai_response_json

```diff
        
  
-       // Call the OpenAI API and wait for the response
-       const stream = await openai.chat.completions.create(
-         {
-           model: data.model,
-           stream: true,
-           messages: [
-             {
-               role: "system",
-               content:
-                 "You are a helpful assistant who always responds in English. Respond without any preamble, explanation, confirmation or commentary, just the final answer.

If requested to respond in JSON, only respond in JSON format, do not enclose it in ```json tags.",
-             },
-             { role: "user", content: data.prompt },
-           ],
-           max_tokens: MAX_TOKENS,
-           temperature: data.temperature,
-           n: 1,
-         }
-       );
+       const oai_request_json = {
+         model: data.model,
+         stream: true,
+         messages: [
+           {
+             role: "system",

+         max_tokens: MAX_TOKENS,

+       };
+ 
+       // Call the OpenAI API and wait for the response
+       const stream = await openai.chat.completions.create(oai_request_json);
+ 
+       let oai_response_json = "";
  
        // Process the stream using async iteration
        for await (const part of stream) {
          const completion = part.choices[0]?.delta?.content;
          if (completion != null) {
+           oai_response_json += completion;
            ws.send(completion);
          }
```

I've updated the `server.ts` file to store the JSON input supplied to `openai.chat.completions.create()` in a variable called `oai_request_json`. Additionally, the reconstructed resultant stream is now stored in a variable called `oai_response_json`. If you have any further changes or questions, feel free to ask!

Okay, it looks like the TypeScript compiler is unhappy with the types of the `oai_request_json` object we created. The `openai` library has specific types for the parameters of the `create` function, and our object definition is too generic.

To fix this, I'll import the correct type `ChatCompletionCreateParamsStreaming` from the `openai` library and apply it to the `oai_request_json` variable. This will ensure that the structure and types within the object match what the function expects.

```typescript
import { ChatCompletionCreateParamsStreaming } from "openai/resources/chat/completions";
```

```typescript
      const oai_request_json: ChatCompletionCreateParamsStreaming = {
        model: data.model,
        stream: true,
        messages: [
          {
            role: "system",
            content:
              "You are a helpful assistant who always responds in English. Respond without any preamble, explanation, confirmation or commentary, just the final answer. Respond in markdown format if requested and make use of ## Headers, *italics*, **bold**, and lists as well as emoticons to make the answer more engaging. If requested to respond in JSON, only respond in JSON format, do not enclose it in ```json tags.",
          },
          { role: "user", content: data.prompt },
        ],
        max_tokens: MAX_TOKENS,
        temperature: data.temperature,
        n: 1,
      };
```

I will add the necessary import statement and apply the type annotation to the `oai_request_json` variable in `server/server.ts`.

```diff
  import { rateLimit, MemoryStore } from "express-rate-limit";
  import OpenAI from "openai";
+ import { ChatCompletionCreateParamsStreaming } from "openai/resources/chat/completions";
  import WebSocket from "ws";
  import cors from "cors";
  
  
-       const oai_request_json = {
+       const oai_request_json: ChatCompletionCreateParamsStreaming = {
          model: data.model,
          stream: true,
```

---

I've added the import for `ChatCompletionCreateParamsStreaming` and applied the type annotation to the `oai_request_json` variable in `server/server.ts`. This should resolve the TypeScript error.
