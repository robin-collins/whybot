# Adding Lint and Format Scripts (2025-04-03 16:51:06)

_**User**_

can you add lint:fix and format scripts and provide code to install or update packages as req.

---

_**Assistant**_

Okay, I can add the `lint:fix` and `format` scripts to your `app/package.json`.

1.  **`lint:fix`**: This script will run ESLint and automatically fix fixable issues based on your configuration.
2.  **`format`**: This script will run Prettier to format your code according to your `.prettierrc` configuration.

I'll edit the `app/package.json` file to add these scripts.

```diff
          "build": "vite build",
          "lint": "eslint src --ext ts,tsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0",
+         "lint:fix": "eslint src --ext ts,tsx --report-unused-disable-directives --fix",
+         "format": "prettier --write src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,json,css,md}",
          "preview": "vite preview"
      },
```

I have added the `lint:fix` and `format` scripts to `app/package.json`.

Regarding package updates, based on your `app/package.json`, you are currently using `openai` version `^3.2.1`. The project rules (`derived-cursor-rules.mdc`) mention updating `openai` to `v4+`. Additionally, the rules mention `firebase-admin` being updated, but it's not listed in your frontend dependencies (`app/package.json`); it's likely a backend dependency.

Do you want me to update the `openai` package in `app/package.json` to the latest `v4` version?

Also, are there any other specific packages you need to install or update in the `app` directory?
